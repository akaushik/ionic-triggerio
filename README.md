Ionic Framework on Trigger.IO
===============


## Ionic Framework

[Ionic](https://github.com/driftyco/ionic) is the open source HTML5 Mobile Framework for building amazing, cross-platform native apps with HTML, JavaScript, and CSS.

We built Ionic because we wanted a framework that focused on building hybrid native apps, rather than mobile websites. We wanted this framework to be obsessive about great design and performance. A framework that left the past behind and focused on the future where mobile devices could make HTML5 feel native.

It's important to realize that Ionic is not a replacement for frameworks used for building mobile web apps. There are a lot
of great solutions that work well for websites, like [jQuery Mobile](http://jquerymobile.com/).

Ionic is also not a good solution if you need to support older generation devices. Our compatibility *starts* at iOS 6 and Android 4.1. We will never support versions earlier than those. This is a framework for the future.
